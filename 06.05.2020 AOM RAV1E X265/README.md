To open image on full, first click image, when right click 'open image in new tab'.

Please note that ffmpeg x265 were using whole cpu having load of ~1100% on 12 threads system.

To match in terms of cpu utilization and speed, for Rav1e and AOM I was using [Av1an](https://github.com/master-of-zen/Av1an). 

For single encoder instance reference multiply av1 time by ~6.
Also please sorry for my impatience with CPU0. It started to take more than hour for single probe. So real encoding time for CPU0 is way over one hour, and that with scene splits.
